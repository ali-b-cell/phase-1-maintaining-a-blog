//Understanding Nested Objects in JavaScript

//When working with JavaScript, you'll often encounter objects within objects—also known as nested objects. These are useful for organizing complex data structures, such as an NBA stats tracker. In this post, we'll break down how to work with nested objects and access their values efficiently.

//What Are Nested Objects?

//A nested object is an object that contains another object as a value. Here's a simple example using an NBA player’s statistics:

const playerStats = {
  name: "LeBron James",
  team: "Los Angeles Lakers",
  stats: {
    pointsPerGame: 27.2,
    assistsPerGame: 7.5,
    reboundsPerGame: 7.4,
  }
};

//In this case, stats is a nested object inside playerStats.

//Accessing Nested Object Properties

//To access properties in a nested object, use dot notation (.) or bracket notation ([]):

console.log(playerStats.name); // "LeBron James"
console.log(playerStats.stats.pointsPerGame); // 27.2

//Alternatively, using bracket notation:

console.log(playerStats["stats"]["assistsPerGame"]); // 7.5

//Handling Deeply Nested Objects

//If an object has multiple levels of nesting, you can chain dot notation to retrieve values. However, if a property is missing, it may cause an error:

const team = {
  name: "Lakers",
  coach: {
    headCoach: "Darvin Ham",
    assistantCoach: "Phil Handy"
  }
};

console.log(team.coach.headCoach); // "Darvin Ham"
console.log(team.coach.manager); // undefined
// console.log(team.coach.manager.name); // ❌ Error: Cannot read properties of undefined

//Using Optional Chaining to Avoid Errors

//JavaScript's optional chaining (?.) helps prevent errors when accessing deeply nested properties:

console.log(team.coach?.manager?.name); // undefined (No error!)

//Looping Through Nested Objects

//If you need to iterate over a nested object, you can use a for...in loop:

for (let key in playerStats.stats) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${playerStats.stats[key]}`);
}

Output:

pointsPerGame: 27.2
assistsPerGame: 7.5
reboundsPerGame: 7.4

//Modifying Nested Objects

//You can update nested object properties like this:

playerStats.stats.pointsPerGame = 28.5;
console.log(playerStats.stats.pointsPerGame); // 28.5

//To add a new property:

playerStats.stats.blocksPerGame = 1.2;
console.log(playerStats.stats.blocksPerGame); // 1.2

//Deleting Nested Properties

//To remove a property from a nested object, use the delete operator:

delete playerStats.stats.reboundsPerGame;
console.log(playerStats.stats.reboundsPerGame); // undefined

Conclusion

//Nested objects are essential for handling structured data in JavaScript. Whether you're working with player statistics or any other complex data, understanding how to access, modify, and loop through nested objects will make your coding life easier!
